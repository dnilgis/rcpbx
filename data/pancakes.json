  "prep": "10 min",
  "rest": "10 min",
  "makes": "12",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "2 tbsp sugar",
    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "1 tsp baking soda",
    "½ tsp salt",
    "2 cups buttermilk",
    "¼ cup sour cream",
    "2 eggs",
    "3 tbsp butter, melted",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.",
    "In another bowl, whisk buttermilk, sour cream, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla.",
    "Pour wet ingredients into dry. Stir until JUST combined. Lumps are okay—don't overmix or you'll get tough pancakes.",
    "Let batter rest 10 minutes. This allows gluten to relax and leavening to activate.",
    "Heat griddle or nonstick pan over medium-low heat. Lightly butter the surface.",
    "Pour ¼ cup batter per pancake. Cook until bubbles form on surface AND edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.",
    "Flip when holes form in the bubbles (not just bubbles appearing). Cook 1-2 minutes more until golden.",
    "Serve immediately with butter and maple syrup."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "REAL buttermilk matters: The acid reacts with baking soda for lift. Homemade substitute works but won't be as fluffy.",
    "DON'T overmix: Lumpy batter = fluffy pancakes. Smooth batter = tough pancakes.",
    "REST the batter: 10 minutes lets the flour hydrate and gluten relax.",
    "When to flip: Not just when bubbles appear—wait until holes form and edges are set.",
    "Keep warm: Hold cooked pancakes on wire rack in 200°F oven while cooking the rest."
