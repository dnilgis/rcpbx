  "category": "Beef",
  "categorySlug": "beef",
  "prep": "5 min",
  "cook": "10 min",
  "serves": "4",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 lb ground beef chuck (80/20)",
    "8 slices American cheese",
    "4 burger buns (potato buns work great)",
    "Kosher salt",
    "Black pepper",
    "2 tbsp butter for buns",
    "Suggested Toppings: Pickle slices, thinly sliced onion, ketchup, mustard, mayo, shredded lettuce"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Divide beef into 8 equal balls (2 oz each). Don't pack them tight—keep them loose.",
    "Heat cast iron skillet or griddle over HIGH heat until smoking hot. This is crucial.",
    "Place 2-4 balls on the hot surface (don't crowd). Immediately smash flat with a sturdy spatula. Press HARD for 10 seconds. Should be very thin.",
    "Season the top with salt and pepper AFTER smashing (not before).",
    "Cook 2 minutes until edges are brown and crispy. Flip.",
    "Immediately add cheese slice. Cook 1 more minute.",
    "Stack 2 patties per burger.",
    "Toast buns in the beef fat on the same pan. Assemble and serve immediately."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Why season AFTER smashing: Salt draws moisture from raw meat. Salting after = better crust.",
    "American cheese: Melts better than anything else. This is not the time for fancy cheese.",
    "The smash: Press as thin as possible. The goal is maximum surface contact = maximum crust.",
    "Why 2 thin patties: More crust per burger. That crust is the whole point.",
    "Ventilation: This creates smoke. Open windows or turn on the fan."
