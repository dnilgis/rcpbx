  "categorySlug": "baking-dessert",
  "prep": "15 min",
  "cook": "25 min",
  "makes": "16",
  "ingredients": [
    "10 tbsp butter (1¼ sticks)",
    "1¼ cups sugar",
    "¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder",
    "¼ tsp salt",
    "½ tsp vanilla extract",
    "2 eggs, cold",
    "½ cup all-purpose flour",
    "⅔ cup chocolate chips (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 325°F. Line 8x8 pan with parchment, leaving overhang for easy removal.",
    "Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium heat.",
    "Remove from heat. Add sugar, cocoa, and salt. Stir until combined—mixture will be grainy and thick.",
    "Let cool 5 minutes (not too long—should still be warm).",
    "Add vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each until smooth and glossy.",
    "Add flour. Stir until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips if using.",
    "Pour into prepared pan. Spread evenly.",
    "Bake 20-25 minutes. Toothpick should come out with moist crumbs, not wet batter.",
    "Cool in pan 15 minutes. Lift out using parchment. Cool completely before cutting."

  "notes": [
    "Hot butter + sugar + cocoa: This is the secret to the shiny crackly top. Don't skip mixing them while butter is hot.",
    "NO baking powder: This makes them fudgy, not cakey. Don't add it.",
    "Minimal flour: Less flour = fudgier. Don't be tempted to add more.",
    "Don't overbake: They should look slightly underdone. They firm up as they cool.",
    "Storage: Keep in airtight container 5 days. Actually better day 2."
