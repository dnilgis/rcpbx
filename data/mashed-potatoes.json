  "categorySlug": "sides",
  "prep": "10 min",
  "cook": "25 min",
  "serves": "8",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 lbs Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1\" chunks",
    "1½ sticks butter (12 tbsp)",
    "1½ cups half-and-half (or 1 cup milk + ½ cup cream)",
    "2 tsp salt, plus more for cooking water",
    "Black pepper to taste"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Place potatoes in large pot. Cover with cold water by 1 inch. Add 1 tablespoon salt.",
    "Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce to medium, simmer until fork-tender, 20-25 minutes.",
    "While potatoes cook, warm butter and half-and-half in small saucepan until butter melts. Keep warm.",
    "Drain potatoes. Return to pot over low heat for 1 minute to dry out any excess moisture.",
    "For smooth: Pass through ricer or food mill into large bowl. For chunky: Mash with potato masher.",
    "Add BUTTER FIRST. Fold in until absorbed. This coats the starch and prevents glueyness.",
    "Then fold in warm half-and-half gradually until desired consistency.",
    "Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "BUTTER FIRST: This is the secret. Fat coats starch granules, preventing gluey texture. Don't add milk first.",
    "Yukon Gold: Naturally buttery flavor and creamy texture. Russets work but are starchier.",
    "Use a ricer: Creates smooth potatoes without overworking. Mashing can make them gluey.",
    "Warm the dairy: Cold liquid cools potatoes and makes them gummy. Always warm first.",
    "Make ahead: Hold in slow cooker on warm up to 2 hours. Add splash of cream when serving."
