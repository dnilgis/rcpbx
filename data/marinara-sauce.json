  ],
  "steps": [

  "notes": [
    "BUTTER not olive oil: This is the whole point. Butter makes it silky and rich. Trust Marcella.",
    "Onion stays whole: It flavors the sauce subtly without overpowering. Discard at the end.",
    "Don't add garlic: Sounds wrong, but this sauce doesn't need it. The simplicity IS the flavor.",
    "San Marzano tomatoes: Worth the extra dollar. Sweeter, less acidic.",
    "Storage: Keeps 1 week refrigerated, freezes well for 3 months."
