    "2 tbsp butter",
    "1 medium onion, diced",
    "3 carrots, sliced into half-moons",
    "3 celery stalks, sliced",
    "3 garlic cloves, minced",
    "8 cups chicken broth (good quality)",
    "1 tbsp tomato paste",

    "8 oz egg noodles",
    "3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken",

  "steps": [
    "Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.",

  "notes": [
    "Broth matters: Use the best quality broth you can find. It's the backbone of the soup.",
    "From scratch: For richer broth, simmer chicken wings with the vegetables for 1 hour before adding noodles.",
    "Noodle tip: If making ahead, store noodles separately. They'll absorb liquid and get mushy.",
    "Storage: Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Freeze broth and chicken without noodles."
