  "categorySlug": "chicken",
  "prep": "5 min",
  "cook": "1 hr",
  "serves": "4",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 whole chicken (3-4 lbs)",
    "Kosher salt",
    "Black pepper"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 450°F. Let chicken sit at room temperature 30 minutes while oven heats.",
    "Remove chicken from packaging. Remove giblets from cavity. Pat VERY dry inside and out with paper towels. This is crucial for crispy skin.",
    "Truss the legs: tie them together with kitchen twine. Tuck wing tips under the body.",
    "Season generously with salt and pepper from about 1 foot above the bird (for even coverage). Season inside the cavity too.",
    "Place chicken breast-side up in cast iron skillet or roasting pan. No rack needed.",
    "Roast 50-60 minutes. DO NOT BASTE. Do not open the oven door. Basting creates steam and prevents crispy skin.",
    "Chicken is done when thigh reaches 165°F (or when juices run clear when thigh is pierced).",
    "Rest 15 minutes before carving. The juices need to redistribute."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "DRY = CRISPY: The #1 secret. Wet skin steams instead of crisping. Pat it bone dry.",
    "No basting: Sounds wrong, but every time you open the oven you lose heat and add moisture. Trust the method.",
    "High heat the whole time: This is what makes the skin shatteringly crispy.",
    "Use the drippings: Spoon them over carved meat, or make a quick pan sauce.",
    "Storage: Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Shred leftover meat for sandwiches, soup, or tacos."
