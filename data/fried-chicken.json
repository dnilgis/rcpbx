  "prep": "30 min",
  "brine": "6+ hrs",
  "serves": "4",
  "ingredients": [
    "Buttermilk Brine: 3-4 lbs chicken pieces (thighs, drumsticks, breasts), 2 cups buttermilk, 2 tbsp kosher salt, 1 tbsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp cayenne",
    "Dredge: 2 cups all-purpose flour, ½ cup cornstarch, 1 tbsp paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp cayenne, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp black pepper",
    "For Frying: Vegetable oil or peanut oil (enough for 1\" depth in pan)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Brine: Whisk buttermilk, salt, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne. Submerge chicken pieces. Refrigerate at least 6 hours, preferably overnight.",
    "Mix dredge: Combine flour, cornstarch, paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper in a wide bowl.",
    "Double dredge: Remove chicken from buttermilk (don't shake off excess). Coat in flour mixture. Dip back in buttermilk. Coat in flour again. Let sit on rack 10 minutes.",
    "Heat oil to 350°F in Dutch oven or deep skillet. Use a thermometer.",
    "Fry in batches (don't crowd): Dark meat 13-15 minutes, breasts 15-18 minutes. Flip halfway. Internal temp should reach 165°F.",
    "Drain on wire rack (not paper towels—they make it soggy). Season with pinch of salt immediately."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Cornstarch = extra crispy: It creates a shatteringly crunchy coating. Don't skip it.",
    "Double dredge: The second coating is what gives you that craggy, crispy exterior.",
    "Don't crowd: Too much chicken drops oil temp = greasy, soggy coating.",
    "Wire rack: Draining on paper towels traps steam and makes bottom soggy.",
    "Storage: Best fresh. Reheat in 400°F oven on wire rack to re-crisp."
