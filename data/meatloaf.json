  "prep": "15 min",
  "cook": "1 hr",
  "serves": "8",
  "ingredients": [
    "Meatloaf: 2 lbs ground beef (80/20), 1 small onion grated (not diced), 3 garlic cloves minced, ¾ cup panko breadcrumbs, ½ cup milk, 2 eggs, 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, 1 tsp Italian seasoning",
    "Glaze: ½ cup ketchup, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top (or just use foil).",
    "Mix panko and milk in large bowl. Let sit 5 minutes (this is the panade).",
    "Add beef, grated onion, garlic, eggs, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Mix gently with hands until just combined. Don't overwork.",
    "Shape into a free-form loaf on prepared pan, about 9x5 inches.",
    "Bake 40 minutes.",
    "While baking, mix glaze ingredients.",
    "Remove from oven, brush with half the glaze. Increase oven to 400°F.",
    "Bake 15-20 more minutes until internal temp reaches 160°F. Brush with remaining glaze halfway through.",
    "Rest 10 minutes before slicing."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "GRATE the onion: Releases moisture without chunks. Keeps meatloaf incredibly moist.",
    "Free-form on sheet pan: Fat drains away, all sides get browned. Loaf pans trap grease and steam the meat.",
    "The panade: Milk-soaked breadcrumbs keep it tender. Same technique as meatballs.",
    "Italian sausage variation: Use 1 lb beef + 1 lb Italian sausage for more flavor.",
    "Storage: Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Makes excellent sandwiches cold."
