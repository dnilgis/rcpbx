  "categorySlug": "baking-dessert",
  "prep": "15 min",
  "cook": "1 hr",
  "makes": "1 loaf",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup mashed very ripe bananas (about 3 medium)",
    "¾ cup brown sugar, packed",
    "⅓ cup vegetable oil",
    "2 eggs",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 cup whole wheat flour (or all AP)",
    "1 tsp baking soda",
    "½ tsp salt",
    "½ tsp cinnamon (optional)",
    "¾ cup walnuts, chopped (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x5 loaf pan.",
    "Mash bananas in large bowl until mostly smooth (some lumps okay).",
    "Add brown sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until combined.",
    "In another bowl, whisk flours, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.",
    "Add dry ingredients to wet. Stir until just combined. Don't overmix.",
    "Fold in walnuts if using.",
    "Pour into prepared pan. Spread evenly.",
    "Bake 60-70 minutes until toothpick comes out clean and internal temp reaches 200°F.",
    "Cool in pan 15 minutes. Remove and cool on rack."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "VERY ripe bananas: Dark spots = more sugar = better flavor. If they're not ripe enough, it won't taste like much.",
    "Oil keeps it moist: Butter tastes great but oil stays softer when cool. Your call.",
    "Brown sugar: Adds caramel notes that complement banana. Don't substitute white.",
    "Freeze ripe bananas: Peel, freeze in bags. Thaw before using—they get extra soft and sweet.",
    "Storage: Keeps 4 days wrapped at room temp. Freezes well for 3 months."
