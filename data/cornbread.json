  "categorySlug": "sides",
  "prep": "10 min",
  "cook": "25 min",
  "serves": "8",
  "ingredients": [
    "1½ cups cornmeal (stone-ground if you can find it)",
    "½ cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 tbsp baking powder",
    "½ tsp baking soda",
    "1 tsp salt",
    "1½ cups buttermilk",
    "1 egg",
    "10 tbsp butter, divided"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 425°F. Place 10-inch cast iron skillet in oven while it heats.",
    "Whisk cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.",
    "Melt 6 tablespoons butter. Whisk with buttermilk and egg in another bowl.",
    "Pour wet ingredients into dry. Stir until just combined. Don't overmix.",
    "Carefully remove hot skillet from oven. Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter, swirl to coat.",
    "Immediately pour batter into sizzling butter. It should sizzle loudly.",
    "Bake 20-25 minutes until golden brown and toothpick comes out clean.",
    "Brush top with more butter if desired. Let cool 5 minutes before slicing."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "HOT skillet + butter = crispy crust: This is non-negotiable. The sizzle when batter hits the pan creates the crust.",
    "No sugar: Southern cornbread is savory. If you want sweet, that's Northern-style (and that's fine, just different).",
    "Cast iron matters: Retains heat, creates crispy edges. A regular pan won't give the same results.",
    "Bacon grease: For extra flavor, replace some butter with bacon drippings.",
    "Serve with: Chili, beans, collard greens, or crumbled into buttermilk (yes, really)."
