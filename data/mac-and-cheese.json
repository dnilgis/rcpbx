  "ingredients": [
    "1 lb elbow macaroni",
    "4 tbsp butter",
    "¼ cup all-purpose flour",
    "3 cups whole milk",
    "1 tsp Dijon mustard",
    "¼ tsp cayenne (optional)",
    "3 cups sharp cheddar, shredded (12 oz)",

  "steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter a 9x13 baking dish.",
    "Cook pasta 2 minutes less than package directions (it'll finish in oven). Drain.",
    "Melt butter in large pot over medium heat. Whisk in flour, cook 1 minute (this is the roux).",
    "Slowly whisk in milk. Cook, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Remove from heat. Stir in mustard, cayenne, cheddar, and Gruyere until melted. Season with salt and pepper.",

  "notes": [
    "SHRED YOUR OWN CHEESE. Pre-shredded has anti-caking agents that prevent smooth melting. This is the #1 tip.",
    "All cheddar works: Skip Gruyere if needed. Use 4 cups sharp cheddar total.",
    "Stovetop version: Skip baking. Just serve the cheese sauce with pasta directly.",
    "Storage: Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Reheat with splash of milk to restore creaminess."
