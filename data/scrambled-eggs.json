  "prep": "1 min",
  "cook": "4 min",
  "serves": "2",
  "ingredients": [
    "6 eggs",
    "3 tbsp butter, cubed",
    "1 tbsp crème fraîche (or sour cream)",
    "Salt and pepper",
    "Fresh chives, chopped (optional)"
  ],
  "steps": [
    "Crack eggs directly into a COLD nonstick saucepan. Add butter. Don't whisk yet.",
    "Place pan over medium heat. Start stirring continuously with a rubber spatula, breaking up the yolks and combining with whites.",
    "As eggs start to thicken, pull pan OFF the heat. Keep stirring for 20 seconds.",
    "Return to heat. Stir constantly. When eggs start to form curds again, pull OFF heat again. Keep stirring.",
    "Repeat this on/off process 3-4 times over about 3 minutes. The eggs should be soft and slightly underdone.",
    "When almost done but still slightly wet, remove from heat completely. Stir in crème fraîche—this stops the cooking.",
    "Season with salt and pepper NOW (not before—early salt makes eggs watery).",
    "Serve immediately topped with chives. Don't let them sit."
  ],
  "notes": [
    "COLD pan start: This lets eggs cook slowly and evenly from the beginning.",
    "ON/OFF the heat: This prevents overcooking. The pan stays hot even off the burner.",
    "Remove while still wet: Carryover heat finishes them. If they look done in the pan, they're overdone on the plate.",
    "Season LAST: Salt draws moisture from eggs. Season after cooking for best texture.",
    "Crème fraîche: Adds creaminess AND stops cooking. Sour cream works too."
